      "weIdentified": "We identified two main problems: a blood donation shortage and a local economic slowdown. Amid the COVID-19 outbreak, blood banks urgently need donors. People who are potential qualifying donors are prompted to stay home and isolate. As donations plummet and demand for blood and plasma increases, blood banks are experiencing a pronounced global shortage.",

      "aDonorCanEarn": "A donor can earn life tokens after completing a blood donation at a Lifebank participating donation center. Donation centers can issue a maximum of 10,000 life tokens. These tokens can then be redeemed by the donor at any local business (or sponsor) in exchange for discounts or promotions.",
